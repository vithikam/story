This was new. She had never thought that she would be the one standing in the crowd , jumping up and down heehaw! this was fun and then she jumped a little bit higher, got caught in the arms of a flying dinosaur and was about to see the insides of heaven when something nudged her on her right elbow. And it was the hunky monkey, she had been going out with picking apples evevry evening for the last week. He winked and she knew she could jump.
